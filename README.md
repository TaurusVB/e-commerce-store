# FakeStore - e-commerce store

This is the open-source code for the store created using my other application, [Admin Dashboard](https://github.com/TaurusVB/e-commerce-admin-dashboard). Here you will find the implementation of features such as product filtering, adding products to the cart, popular products, all product categories, secure payment using Stripe, and a product gallery.
